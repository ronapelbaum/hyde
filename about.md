## Who am I?
Hi! I’m Ron.

I’m an experienced software engineer living in Jerusalem, Israel.

I am a full stack web developer, code oriented,  thrilled about javascript, angularjs and other cool front-end techs, great team player and tech leader.

I also enjoy good old music and good old scotch.

Follow me!
